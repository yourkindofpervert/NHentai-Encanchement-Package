# NHentai-Encanchement-Package
It's like Reddit Enhancement Suite, but for hentai

A quick Sunday project I made to see if I could. I'm not gonna say it's the best thing ever, but it works.

## HOW DO I USE THIS?
Download the `nhentai-ext.crx` file in the `dist` folder and install it. Either Chrome will install it automagically or you can go to chrome://extensions and drag it into the window there.

## WHAT IS IT?
At this point, all it does is enables an extra icon on the toolbar of http://nhentai.net, that will find all tags
associated with all items on a page. Currently does not work for the Favorites page because of a major difference in page layout.
Currently it's only designed to work with the main page, search pages, and pages like them.

Once the tags are gathered, you can select which tags you'd like to filter by for this page and then click the "Filter" button.
To clear the filter, click the "Clear Filter" button. By default, it filters by an `AND` algorithm (futanari AND lolicon, for example).
You can change it to an `OR` algorithm by changing the dropdown next to the "Clear Filter" button, and running the filter again.

I may not do anything with this again. Depends on if it takes off or not. I'm currently swamped with my last year of university, so I doubt I'll have time.
Pull requests are more than welcome. Please post any and all issues to the Issues section of this repository.

## WILL YOU PORT THIS TO FIREFOX?
Probably not. Don't have enough time. Again, pull requests are welcome.

## WHY IS THIS NOT IN THE CHROME WEB STORE?
Because I'm lazy. Maybe later.
